# toca
Toca is a MIDI-controller with a tactile interface that is made to be explored with your hands. To find the unexpected rather than to perform with perfection. When you put your fingers over two or more of the metal pads your skin becomes part of the circuit. The analog circuit detects the amount of touch and a raspberry pi Pico sends MIDI over USB with both veolocity and aftertouch. Since everyone's skin is different the experience will be different and you have to find your own unique way of playing.

The pads from melted tinn are made from reused material and the layout is parametricaly design in grasshopper to enable every unit to be unique. The enclosure is made of solid spruce and is CNC machined.

The two wooden buttons and the small joystick are used to capture your gestures and play them back as loops. Instead of you having to first press record and then perform exactly as rehearst this interface lets you explore freely and press record afterwards to capture what youâ€™ve just played. When you stumble on something that you like you decide the length of the loop after the fact.

I'm more of a designer then a coder so please be gentle when assesign the code;) The project is working but but some bugs needs to be ironed out and plenty more functionality could be added. 

If you want access to the CAD-files for the enclosure plese let me know.
