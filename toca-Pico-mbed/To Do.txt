------TO DO------
* Why does it just hang some times??? Probably some array that tries to get read or written out of bounds
* Sometimes the loop gets stuck. I don't know why.

* Make functions for buttons and joystick
  * Can updateJoy be done inside buttons instead of its own function?
  * can getJoy be just joyValue * getClock?

* LEDHandler
  * Prio doesn't seem to work.
  * Can nLeds, nPins and nColors be defined in main.h?
  * Add LED events on pad

* First event after startup is missed in playback in TapeRecall
* Clock
  * Try using micros() instead. Need to implement with different the resolutions of different arduinos in mind
  * Averageing isn't doing what I think. Bigger array doesn't help. even a 1 millisecond error per quarternote gets in to 16th note territory prety quickly.
  * Might be because of all the serial data slowing the pico down. Yes, alot because of that.
  * can clockArray be byte? 255 * 24 is 6 second per quarternote? But wouldn't work well with first new value. Needs to be capped instead of overflowed
  *

* If recal is made witout any data in the recal lenght. recallIndex will stay the same as from the last successfull recal. Might not be a bug but a feature? Or might not do anything
* Is setting up the pins with input pulldown (in ResSensor.setup()) affecting the values read by them?
* Look into defining callsbacks in main.h file
* Clean upp commented serial prints in TapeRecall

* Exclude libraries that aren't needed
* Add CV functionality
* Add tap tempo functionality??

# Serial communication is buffered and not realtime. For example, note off might not be showned until more data is sent. Debugg through MIDIOx
# Serial communication doesn't initiate until a while. between 100 and 4000 loops. Doesn't need a fix just remember.

# static variables are always global to it's class. Not specific to any specific instance of it.
# do intilialize variables to a value before use
